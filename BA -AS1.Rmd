## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
summary(Online_Retail)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tinytex)
library(readr)
library(ISLR)
library(ggplot2)
set.seed(111)
```


```{r}
ORR<-read.csv("Online_Retail.csv")

#2 Creating  a new variables ' Transaction Value ' that is the product of the  existing #"quantity' and "Unit price' variables .Add this variable to the  data frame 

ORR<-mutate(ORR,"TransactionValue"=TransactionValue<-Quantity*UnitPrice)
head(ORR[,9])





##3 Using the newly craeted variables, Transcation value, show the breakdown of transaction value #by  country 


ORR %>%
