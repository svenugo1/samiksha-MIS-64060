## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Objective is to interpret the working structure of the pharmacetuical industry using 
## financial data with reference to 21 firms.


##a) Using only the numerical variables( 1 to 9 ) to cluster the 21 firms.Justifying the various
##  choices made in conducting the cluster analysis , such as weight for different variables,  
## specific clustering algorithms used , the  number of clusters formed , and so on

## Data Preparation 
## Prior to clusting data , remove or estimate missing data and rescale variables for comparability 


summary(Pharmaceuticals)
x<-na.omit(Pharmaceuticals)# listwise deletion of missing 


#collecting only the quantitive variables(1-9)to cluster the 21 firms

Pharmaceuticals1<-Pharmaceuticals[,3:11]
head(Pharmaceuticals1)



#Scale all the quantitative variables in the dataframe ( Z - score )
Pharmaceuticals2 <- scale(Pharmaceuticals1)
head(Pharmaceuticals2)

##  Determining the number of clusters to do the cluster analysis 
##  Calculating number of clusters using Elow Method 


fviz_nbclust(Pharmaceuticals2,kmeans,method = "wss") + labs (subtitle = "Elow Method ")

#Silhouette method for determing number of clusters
fviz_nbclust(Pharmaceuticals2,kmeans, method ="silhouette") +labs(subtitle = "silhouette Method")

k5<- kmeans(Pharmaceuticals2,centers = 5,nstart = 25)


##With the plots shown above, it is clear that the number of clusters are 5 and they are enough to show the variations in the data

set.seed(111)
k5<-kmeans 




k5<- kmeans(Pharmaceuticals2,centers=5,nstart = 25) 
#Visualize the output
k5$centers #centroids
fviz_cluster(k5,data = Pharmaceuticals2)#Visualize the clusters



# k-Means Cluster Analysis - Fit the data with 5 clusters

fit<-kmeans(Pharmaceuticals2,5)

#Finding the mean value of all quantitative variables for each cluster
aggregate(Pharmaceuticals2,by=list(fit$cluster),FUN=mean)

##append cluster assignment
Pharmaceuticals3<-data_frame(Pharmaceuticals2,fit$cluster)
Pharmaceuticals3


# By observation the mean values of all quantitive variable for each cluster


##b) Interpret the clusters with respect to the numerical variable used in forming the clusters.
#Cluster 1 - Row 5,9,14,20
#Cluster 2 - Row 1,3,4,10,16,19,21 
#Cluster 3 -Row 2,6,18 
# Cluster 4 -Row 6,8,12 
# Cluster 5 -Row 11, 13, 15, 17 


# Cluster 1 has the lowest Market_Cap,highest Beta,lowest PE_Ratio,highest Leverage, highest
#Rev_Growth.
#Cluster 2 has the lowest Rev_Growth, higest Net_Profit_Margin
# Cluster 3 has the highest PE_Ratio, lowest ROE,lowest ROA,lowest Net_Profit_Margin
#Cluster 4 has the lowest Beta,lowest Asset_Turnover 
#Cluster 5 has the highest Market_Cap,highest ROE, highest ROA, highest Asset_Turnover,lowest
#Leverage


#c) Is there a pattern in the clusters with respect to the numerical variable (10 to 12)?( those not used in forming thr clusters )
#There is a pattern in the clusters with respect to Media recommendation variable.
# Cluster 1 with highest Beta, highest Levergae, highest Rev_Growth has mostly Moderate Buy 
#Recommendation.
# Cluster 2 with highest Net ProfiT_Margin has moslty Hold Recommendation.
#Cluster 3 with highest PE_ Ratio has Hold Recommendation
##Cluster 4  with lowest Asset_ Turnover has the strong Buy Recommendation
#Cluster 5 with highest Markrt_cap, highest ROE, highest ROA, highest Asset_Turnover has equal
##  Hold and Moderate Buy Recommendation

#Could see a pattern among rhe clusters with respect to variavles ( 10-12)
## Clusters 1,4 has mostly Moderate Buy Recommendation 
# Clusters 2, 3 has mostly Hold Recommendation

#d) Provide an appropriate name  each cluster using any or all  the variables in the 
#datasets.

#Cluster1 - low Market_Cap,high Beta,Low PE_Ratio, high Leverage , high Rev_Growth cluster 
#Cluster2 - low Rev_Growth , high Net _Profit_Margin cluster 
#Cluster 3 -high PE_Ratio , low ROE,low Net_Profit_Margin cluster
#Cluster 4 -low Beta,,low Asset_Turnover cluster
#Cluster 5 -high Market_ Cap , high ROE, High RoA ,high Asset_ Turnover ,low Leverage Cluster

##Visualize the cluster plot
library(cluster)

```



```{r}

### Reconsidering the data 
df<-Pharmaceuticals[c(3,11)]
head(Pharmaceuticals1)

# Considering Assets_Turnover and Net_Profit_Margin two numerical variables column
# Asset turn over measures the efficiency of a company's assets in generating revenue and 
# Net profit is how much a net income a company makes with total sales achieved .
# These two variables are consider to know which industry is better preforming in the industry.

# Scaling the data frame (z score)
df<-scale(df)
