## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



##loading all the required libraries 
```{r loading packages}

library(gmodels)

##Reading the universal bank file to UB
```{r reading Ub}

UB<-read.csv("C:/Users/SAMIKSHA/Desktop/UniversalBank.csv")
Universal_bank<-read.csv("UniversalBank.csv")

```

##view
```{r  summary UB}

head(Universal_bank)

```

##change numerical variable to categorical variables
```{r changing value}
UB<- Universal_bank[,c(10,13,14)]
head(UB)
UB$Personal.Loan <- factor(UB$Personal.Loan)
UB$Online<-factor(UB$Online)
UB$CreditCard<-factor(UB$CreditCard)
```

##Split dataset into training (60%) and test(40%)
```{r}
set.seed(111)

train.index<-sample(row.names(UB),0.6*dim(UB)[1])
test.index<-setdiff(row.names(UB),train.index)
train.df<-UB[train.index,]
test.df<-UB[test.index,]
train<-UB[train.index,]
test<- UB[test.index,]
head(test)
```


##A)Create a pivot table for the training data with Online as a column ##variable,CC as a row variable, and loan as second variable.The values inside table should covey the count.In R use function melt() and cast (),or function table().


```{r}


melt.UB =melt(train,id=c("Personal.Loan","CreditCard"),variable="Online")
recast.UB=dcast(melt.UB, Personal.Loan+CreditCard ~ Online,length)
recast.UB

```
##B)Consider the task of classifing a customer who owns a bank credit card and ## actively using an online banking service.Looking at the Probability of Loan 
## acceptance given having a bank credit card and user of online service is
##87/3000=0.029
## 87+812=899
## 87/899=0.096

###C
##Create two separate pivot table for the training data.One will have loan ##ows) as a function of online (column) and the other will have loan (rows) as  ##a function CC

```{r}

table(train[,c(1,2)])
table(train[,c(1,3)])
```



###D. Compute the following quantities [P(A | B) means “the probability of A given B”]:=
```{r}
###i. P(CC = 1 | Loan = 1) (the proportion of credit card holders among the loan acceptors)

Prop_1<-table(train[,c(3,1)])
F1<-Prop_1[2,2]/(Prop_1[2,2]+Prop_1[1,2])
F1
```

```{r}
###ii. P(Online = 1 | Loan = 1)
Prop_2<-table(train[,c(2,1)])
F2<-Prop_2[2,2]/(Prop_2[2,2]+Prop_2[1,2])
F2

```

```{r}
###iii. P(Loan = 1) (the proportion of loan acceptors)
Prop_3<-table(train[,1])
F3<-Prop_3[2]/(Prop_3[2]+Prop_3[1])
F3

```

```{r}

 ###iv. P(CC=1|Loan=0)
Prop_4<-table(train[,c(3,1)])
F4<-Prop_4[2,1]/(Prop_4[2,1]+Prop_4[1,1])
F4

```

```{r}
###v. P(Online = 1 | Loan = 0)
Prop_5<-table(train[,c(2,1)])
F5<-Prop_5[2,1]/(Prop_5[2,1]+Prop_5[1,1])
F5

```


```{r}
###vi. P(Loan = 0)
Prop_6<-table(train[,1])
F6<-Prop_6[1]/(Prop_6[1]+Prop_6[2])
F6

```

##E)
##Use quantites computed above to compute the naive Bayes probability ##P(Loan=1|cc=1,Online =1).


##Naive_Bayes Probabiliity =(F1*F2*F3)/[(F1*F2*F3)+(F4*F5*F6)]
#0.2979452*0.6164384*0.09733333/0.2979452*0.6164384*0.09733333+
##0.2998523*0.5893648*0.902667


##F)comparing the value with the one obtained from the privot table in .Which is ##more accurate estimate ?  
##      
## the difference between the extract method and the naive- baise method  is 
##method would need the exact same independent variable classification  to 
##predict, where the naive bayee method does not.

# Performing Naive Bayes on the training data
```{r}
require("e1071")
NBmodel<-train[,c(1,2,3)]
NBmodel1<-naiveBayes(Personal.Loan~.,data=NBmodel)
NBmodel1
```
# After running the naive Bayes on the data, value obtained is 0.176690941,whereas the value obtained from is0.100768338 which are  almost similar
